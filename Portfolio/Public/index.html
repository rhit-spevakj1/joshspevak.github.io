      <p>I'm Josh, a CS major at the Rose-Hulman institute of Technology. While I love cs,
         I have a great passion for gaming, music, and hiking. Throughout my time studying
         cs, I have developed great passion of trying to think through new and unique challenges
         which are both interesting, and helpful in some way. Throughout my life, discovery 
         and study of new subjects has fascinated me and I often try to broaden my own knowledge
         of what I am studying and trying to learn.
      </p>

      <p>Meeting and getting to know new people is a passion I care for deeply as I believe in 
        a wide range of collaboration and most of my work in the past has widely ranged with 
        people that I've come to enjoy being around and working with. As I grow in the field of 
        CS I hope to meet others that share similar interests that I can get to know better and 
        maybe even collaborate with in the future! 
      </p>
